# Microprocessor-Laboratory
### In this repository, I have placed the codes of the microprocessor laboratory assignments I passed in IUT.

#### Contents are as follows:
1. Practice with input and output devices.
2. Learn how to use subroutines.
3. Explore interrupt handling and display devices.
4. Use timers and interrupts with LCDs.
5. Control stepper and DC motors.
6. Convert analog signals to digital values.
7. Communicate using UART protocol.
8. Create graphics and animations with LCD and dot matrix.
